Booking App - AirBNB clone using MERN stack

The Front end uses React, TailwindCSS, TypeScript, and Vite and the Back end is powered by Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose.

Key Features:
1. User Authentication: Easy registration and login procedures. I used mongoose for validation and jwt tokens for user cookies for retaining user info and logging out.
2. Booking Places: Users can view available places, book them, check the details of their bookings in their profile and delete the bookings that they have made. It also serves as a history page for past bookings.
3. Listing places: Users can list their own properties for others to discover. The locations they have previously listed can also be edited or removed.

Note: .env file holds mongoURL and SECRET TOKEN which is not included in this repository. .env file is required to run this project.
